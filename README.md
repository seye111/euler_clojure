Clojure solutions to Project Euler http://projecteuler.net problems. My username - seye-clojure.

Note: these solutions have been written whilst learning clojure and, as such, are not to be viewed as canonical or necessarily the most efficient.

By definition, this project publishes SPOILERS in the form of solutions to the problems. You are strongly urged to only use this project for information (even if only as a painful lesson in what not to do), rather than to cheat. You will only be cheating yourself!!!
